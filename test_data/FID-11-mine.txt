The utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in education has surged, leading to a rise in published studies. Despite this, comprehensive large-scale reviews in this field are lacking. This study aims to bridge this gap by analyzing 4,519 publications from 2000 to 2019, using topic-based bibliometrics to identify trends and topics related to AI applications in education (AIEd). Results indicate a growing interest in using AI for educational purposes within the academic community.
