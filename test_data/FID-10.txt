Artificial intelligence (AI) mirrors human intelligence by enabling machines to execute tasks traditionally handled by humans, leveraging technologies like machine learning and neural networks. While AI systems can adapt and improve through learning, concerns persist regarding ethical implications such as privacy infringement and biases in decision-making. As AI continues to evolve, responsible development practices become imperative to navigate its societal impact.
